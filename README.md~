# udacity_sdc_T1P5_VehicleTracking

Big concepts covered in this unit:

Supervised learning classifiers.
-Linear decision surface: Just a simple line on scatter plot.
-Naive Bayes: Curvy-ish line on scatter plot.
-Support Vector Machine: Maximizes margin (seems sort of like MSE). Good for non-linear classification with kernel trick, resulting in new variable.
-Decision Trees: Make clumpy x-y scatterplot linearly separable by taking it in stages. Prone to overfitting.
